# AuraNet

A tiny offline-first task board + focus timer (static site). Tasks and timer settings are saved locally in your browser (`localStorage`).

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)

Pushing to `main` triggers the GitHub Pages workflow (deploys the `web/` folder).

Expected URL:
- `https://okok147.github.io/AuraNet/`
